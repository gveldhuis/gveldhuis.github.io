                    <p>What's up! My name's Grant, and I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science with a minor in Business.</p>
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    <p>This summer, I'll be working at <b><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/">IBM Consulting</a></b> helping F500 clients transform their businesses with tech. Last year I worked at <b><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/quality/top-ranked">Mayo Clinic</a></b> building software apps for physicians, and currenty I run <b><a href="https://www.blueprintsforpangaea.org">Blueprints For Pangaea</a></b>, a nonprofit that ships medical supplies overseas.</p>
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    <p>If you couldn’t already tell, I’m a total healthcare nerd. I’m fascinated with how the American health system does (and doesn’t) work and am unbelievably passionate about developing technology that helps make people healthier.</p>
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    <p>When I’m not pouring over VSCode or geeking out about the most recent healthtech merger, I love hiking a million miles away from home, playing classical music on my keyboard, and listening to Daft Punk.</p>
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    <p>Whether we sound like long-lost twins or share absolutely nothing in common, I’d love to meet you either way. Get in touch with me <b><Link to='/contact' id='contact'>here!</Link></b></p>
